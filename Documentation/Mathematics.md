### Median

- The median is the value separating the highest half from the lower half of a data sample.
- The floor function is the function that takes as input a real number x, and gives as output the greatest integer less than or equal to x, denoted floor(x) or ⌊x⌋
- Similarly, the ceiling function maps x to the least integer greater than or equal to x, denoted ceil(x) or ⌈x⌉
